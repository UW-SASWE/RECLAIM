RECLAIM
=======

**First-of-its-kind globally scalable tool to predict reservoir sedimentation, screen vulnerable reservoirs, and pinpoint those struggling the most.**

RECLAIM (*Reservoir Estimation of Capacity Loss using AI-based Methods*) is a globally scalable framework for predicting **absolute sedimentation rates** in reservoirs.  
It integrates observed records with multi-decadal Earth observations from satellites to provide:

- **Rapid assessment** of sedimentation risk  
- **Scalable predictions** across diverse climates and geographies  
- **Cost-effective screening** to prioritize reservoirs for detailed surveys  
- **Decision support** for planning mitigation interventions where they are most urgently needed  

.. note::
   RECLAIM is designed as a screening tool â€” not a replacement for detailed field surveys, but a way to guide **where and when to act first**.
